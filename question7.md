## Real-Time Performance Monitoring and Alerts
**Use-Case:** Develop a real-time monitoring system that tracks web performance metrics (like TTFB, DOM Content Loaded, Page Load Time) and sends alerts when certain thresholds are breached.

**Additional Data Sources:** Integrate data from network conditions (e.g., latency, bandwidth), user location, and device types.

**Derived Metrics:** Combine performance metrics with user engagement metrics (e.g., bounce rate, session duration) to create a "User Experience Index

I'll design this by using a combination of real-time data streams (Kafka), stream processing (Kinesis), and a monitoring dashboard (Datadog/Splunk/Grafana) for visualization.
## Predictive Maintenance for Web Applications**
**Use-Case:** Build a predictive maintenance system that anticipates when a web application might experience performance degradation and suggests preemptive measures.

**Additional Data Sources:** Historical performance data, server load metrics, traffic patterns, and seasonality trends.
**Derived Metrics:** Develop predictive models using machine learning to forecast performance issues. Combine with anomaly detection to identify unusual behavior.

Building this would be amazing with an ML engineer or utilizing AWS sagemaker

## Personalized User Experience Optimization
**Use-Case:** Use performance data to tailor the user experience based on the userâ€™s environment (device, network speed, location).

**Additional Data Sources:** User profiling data (demographics, behavior patterns), device and browser information, network quality data.

**Derived Metrics:** Create a "Performance Score" for each user session and adjust content delivery (e.g., lower-resolution images for slower networks).

Implement a serverless architecture (e.g., AWS Lambda) that dynamically adjusts content based on real-time performance data.

These are some use cases that I can brainstorm into bringing more RT optimization using the data available. Most from my experience in retail and finance. (All using data from user interactions)
