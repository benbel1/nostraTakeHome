**first_contentful_paint**	        Time it takes to render the first piece of content after a user navigates to a page.

**navigation_start**	            Time when a user starts navigation to a page.

**response_start**	                Time when the browser starts getting response from the server.

**response_end**	                Time when the response from the server is completed.

**dom_loading**	                    Time when browser starts loading the document object.

**dom_interactive**	                Records the time when the document is fully parsed and browser is ready for user interaction

**dom_content_loaded_event_start**	The time when the DOMContentLoaded event starts firing.

**_edge_cf_country**	            The country of the user inferred from the IP address.



## **A lot of these fields are relevant to core web vitals and performance metrics. Below, I'll talk about 5 of them.**

**first_contentful_paint (FCP)** FCP is a critical metric as it indicates how quickly users perceive the page as loading. A faster FCP generally improves user satisfaction and engagement. the lower this number is, the better.

**visually_ready** This metric is important because it reflects the point at which users can begin to meaningfully interact with the content, impacting the overall user experience.

**dom_content_loaded_event_end** The DOMContentLoaded time is significant because it indicates how quickly the HTML structure of a page is available for the browser to start executing scripts, which is crucial for rendering performance. The aim is to always get this number lower.

**navigation_start** This is the baseline for many other timing metrics, allowing developers to calculate the duration between different events during the page load process.

**dom_complete** This is crucial for understanding the total time it takes for a page to fully load and become usable, which affects the overall user experience and performance metrics.
