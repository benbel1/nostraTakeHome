# Based on the aggregated metrics (mean, median, and 75th percentile for TTFB, DOM Content Loaded Time, and Page Load Time), my conclusions about the web page's performance are as follows:

## **My Conclusions based on each metric**
### 1. **Time to First Byte (TTFB):**
   - **Low TTFB Values:** A low TTFB across both groups suggests that the server is responsive and can quickly begin delivering content to users. This is critical for good performance as it ensures that the user's browser can start rendering the page promptly.
   - **Comparison Between Assignments:** If there is a noticeable difference in TTFB between different `_edge_assignment` groups (e.g., "test" vs. "control"), it may indicate that server-side configurations, CDN effectiveness, or backend optimizations vary between these groups.

### 2. **DOM Content Loaded Time:**
   - **Quick DOM Loading:** Short DOM Content Loaded Times suggest that the HTML structure of the page is being loaded and parsed efficiently, enabling the browser to start executing scripts and rendering the content sooner.
   - **Impact of JavaScript:** High DOM Content Loaded Time may indicate heavy or inefficient JavaScript execution, which can delay interactivity. If the "test" group has a significantly higher DOM Content Loaded Time, it could imply that changes in this group involve more complex scripts or additional resources.

### 3. **Page Load Time:**
   - **Overall Load Efficiency:** A lower Page Load Time is always preferable, as it means users can interact with a fully loaded page sooner. If one group (e.g., "test") has a longer Page Load Time, it might suggest that the changes being tested (e.g., new features, additional content) are negatively impacting performance.
   - **Resource Loading:** High Page Load Times could point to larger assets (like images or videos), slower third-party resources, or unoptimized code being loaded as part of the page.

## **My Observations:**
- **Consistency Across Metrics:** If one group consistently performs better (lower times across all metrics), it suggests that the changes associated with that group are more performance-optimized.
- **Discrepancies Between Mean and Percentiles:** Large discrepancies between mean and 75th percentile values might indicate that while the average performance is good, a significant portion of users are experiencing slower load times. This can be due to a variety of reasons, such as geographic distribution, network conditions, or device capabilities.
- **Testing Group Differences:** If the "test" group has worse performance metrics, this could indicate that new features or changes being tested need optimization before being rolled out more widely.

## **Ambiguities and Concerns:**

1. **Variation in User Conditions:** Metrics like TTFB can be affected by network latency, which varies based on the user's location and connection quality. Aggregated metrics might obscure these variations, leading to conclusions that donâ€™t apply uniformly to all users.

2. **Type of Device:**  Users on mobile devices might experience different load times than those on desktops, but if the metrics are aggregated without considering device type, important nuances could be missed. OS, System Specs will play a role as well

3. **Sample Size and Distribution:** If the number of samples in one `_edge_assignment` group is significantly smaller, the metrics might not be as reliable. The results could be skewed by outliers or insufficient data points.

4. **Limited Scope:** These metrics only measure the performance of a single web page. If other pages on the website perform differently, these results might not fully represent the user experience across the site.

5. **Other Performance Metrics:** Important metrics like Time to Interactive (TTI), First Input Delay (FID), and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) are missing, providing a more holistic view of performance.

### **Final Thoughts**
Aggregated metrics can provide a solid overview of a page's performance and highlight potential issues or improvements. However, to draw actionable insights, it's crucial to consider factors like device type, network conditions, and the nature of the test changes. Additionally, understanding the distribution of data and addressing any outliers or anomalies can help in making more informed decisions about web performance optimization. We can also consider adding more metric information to gain a deeper understanding of webpage performance. Also, with visualization, we'll be able to track performance over time to identify trends.
